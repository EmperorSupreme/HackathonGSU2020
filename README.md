# HackathonGSU2020
We are creating an app that is meant to act as an extension for company based chat services such as microsoft teams. 
The objective of the app is to analyze the data from a users/team members profile page and create a smalltalk page that
layout strong broad talking points that would allow one to start a conversation that a user may value very much. 
Topics such as important holidays or festivals that occur from a users home city or cultural delicacies would appear on the smalltalk page.
By bringing up these talking points it can allow a new employee or intern from a different country/culture to ease into transitioning into a new team and feel secure.
